# Wood Empire

**Wood Empire** is a casual tycoon simulation game where you step into the shoes of a property owner and entrepreneur. In this immersive experience, you manage your own wood empireâ€”chop down trees to gather wood, process it into planks, and craft various items like chairs, boxes, and buckets to expand and decorate your establishment. In order to earn money, you must sell your resources and crafted goods to customers, fueling the growth of your empire.

## Game Overview

In **Wood Empire** you take on the role of an owner managing a wood processing and crafting business. The core gameplay loop includes:
- **Chopping Trees:** Harvest wood by felling trees.
- **Processing Wood:** Convert raw wood into usable planks.
- **Crafting Items:** Use planks to craft furniture and tools such as chairs, boxes, and buckets.
- **Selling Resources:** Earn money by selling your gathered wood and crafted items to customers, which helps finance upgrades and expand your operations.

## Key Features

- **Casual Tycoon Gameplay:**  
  Manage resources, upgrade your facilities, and expand your wood empire.
  
- **Crafting System:**  
  Convert raw materials into planks and then into a variety of crafted items.

- **Economic Simulation:**  
  To generate revenue, you must sell your resources and crafted products. Balancing production, inventory, and market demand is key to thriving in the wood business.

- **Advanced OOP & Design Patterns:**  
  The game is built with a heavy emphasis on clean, maintainable code. It leverages:
  - **Strategy Pattern:** For flexible behavior modification across different game systems.
  - **SOLID Principles:** To ensure the codebase remains modular, extensible, and testable.
  - **Robust OOP Architecture:** Ensuring that each system is decoupled and easy to extend or refactor.

- **Responsive and Scalable:**  
  The systems are designed for smooth performance, allowing for future expansions and additional features.

## Architecture & Design

The codebase follows advanced object-oriented programming practices with a focus on:
- **Modularity:** Each game system (e.g., resource management, crafting, animation) is encapsulated in its own module.
- **Strategy Pattern Implementation:** Critical operations (like item crafting, resource processing, and selling) can be dynamically swapped or extended, making the game highly adaptable.
- **SOLID Principles:** The architecture is designed to promote single-responsibility and open-closed principles, ensuring that new features can be added with minimal impact on existing code.
